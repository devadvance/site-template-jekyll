# Site template for Jekyll

A basic Jekyll template that is responsive, lightweight, and only uses JavaScript for progressive enhancement.

## Development

### Dependencies

Use `make install` to get the necessary dependencies.

### Run

Use `make s` or `make serve` to serve using Jekyll.

This includes livereload to automatically refresh the page when you save changes.

### Modify

At a minimum, you should modify these files:

* `_config.yml` - update this with your site information.
* `index.html` - update this with your landing page content.
* `_includes/body-navbar.html` - update this with your navigation structure.

You are strongly encouraged to update dependencies as well.

From there, you add pages, posts, content, and anything else!

### Build
